# Why Boundless?

The Web3 ecosystem is full of ideas — but trust remains a challenge:

* Builders struggle to secure fair, transparent funding.
* Backers worry about scams, failed milestones, and rug pulls.
* Ecosystem partners lack tools to run grants & hackathons transparently.

Boundless solves this with:

* Escrow smart contracts → funds locked until milestones are achieved.
* Community validation → ensuring only credible projects rise.
* Transparency & tracking → every update, milestone, and transaction is visible.
