# What is Boundless?

Boundless is a Web3-native platform for innovation funding.

It helps builders validate ideas, raise capital milestone by milestone, and grow with transparency.

At the same time, it gives funders, backers, and partners confidence through escrow-powered disbursements and community validation.

Boundless is starting on Stellar, but soon expanding across other blockchains.
