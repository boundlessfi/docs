Connecting your Stellar wallet is essential for participating in Boundless. This guide will help you set up and connect your wallet.

## What is a Wallet?

Wallets are digital tools used to send, receive, and store the keys you use to sign blockchain transactions. Think of a wallet as your personal interface with the Stellar blockchain â€“ it doesn't actually hold your funds, but instead stores the private keys that give you access to your assets on the blockchain.

## Available Wallet Options

If you don't already have a Stellar wallet, we recommend starting with xBull or Albedo:

1. **Download/Install the wallet**
   - Visit the official website of your chosen wallet provider
   - Install the browser extension or mobile app
   - Follow the setup instructions

2. **Generate your wallet**
   - The wallet will create a new Stellar account for you
   - You'll receive a secret recovery phrase (typically 12-24 words)
   - **CRITICAL**: Write down this phrase on paper and store it somewhere safe
   - Never share this phrase with anyone or store it digitally

3. **Secure your wallet**
   - Enable additional security features like password protection and biometrics
   - Consider using a hardware wallet for large investments
   - Always verify transaction details before confirming

## Funding Your Wallet with XLM

Before using your wallet with Boundless, you'll need some XLM (Stellar Lumens):

1. Purchase XLM through an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken
2. Withdraw the XLM to your Stellar wallet address
3. Maintain a small XLM balance (1-5 XLM) to cover transaction fees and account activation

## The Importance of Your Recovery Phrase

Your recovery phrase is the master key to your wallet:

- If you lose access to your device, this phrase is the only way to recover your funds
- Store it offline in a waterproof, fireproof location
- Consider making a backup stored in a different physical location
- Never take photos of it or store it in digital form
- If someone gets your phrase, they can take all your assets

## Why Connect Your Wallet to Boundless

Connecting your wallet to Boundless enables you to:

- Contribute to projects you want to support
- Receive equity stakes in the projects you back
- Collect profit shares when projects succeed
- Vote on milestone approvals and other governance decisions
- Trade your equity stakes with other users

Your wallet connection is secure - we never have access to your private keys or recovery phrase. Boundless only requests permission to initiate transactions, which you'll always need to review and approve through your wallet.
