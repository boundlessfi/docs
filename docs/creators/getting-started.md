# Getting Started as a Creator

Turning your blockchain project idea into reality is simple with Boundless. Our platform guides you through each step from concept validation to funding and milestone tracking.

## Starting Your Project

Ready to launch your idea? Here's how to get started:

### Access the Creation Form

1. Click the "Create now" button on the "Become a creator" sidebar panel
2. Or use the "+ New Project" button from an existing project page if you've already created a project

### Enter Your Project Details

- **Project Title**: Choose something memorable and descriptive
- **Description**: Write a clear explanation of your concept, what problem it solves, and why it's unique
- **Funding Goal**: Set your target amount in USDC (the equivalent XLM amount will display automatically)
- **Category**: Select the most relevant category for your project (Technology, Finance, Media, etc.)

### Add Visual Elements

- **Banner Image**: Upload a high-quality horizontal image for the top of your project page
- **Profile Image**: Add a logo or icon that will represent your project throughout the platform
- You can upload files directly or paste image URLs for both

### Complete the Submission

1. Click the "Create Project" button when you're satisfied with your details
2. Your connected wallet will open a confirmation dialog
3. Sign the transaction with your wallet password
4. You'll see a "Creating Project..." status as your submission is processed

## The Validation Phase

After creation, your project doesn't immediately open for funding. First, it enters a validation period:

- Your project page will display an "Initial Phase" badge
- The validation progress section will show "Currently in community validation phase"
- Your supporter count and funding goal will be visible but not yet active

This phase is crucial for:
- Getting early feedback on your concept
- Building community interest before asking for funds
- Making improvements based on potential backer suggestions
- Establishing credibility in the ecosystem

Use this time to promote your project, engage with the community, and refine your offering.

## Setting Up Project Milestones

Milestones are a cornerstone of Boundless projects. They break your project into achievable phases and build trust with backers by showing a clear roadmap.

### Create Milestones

1. Click the "Add Milestone" button on your project page
2. Define each milestone with:
   - **Title**: A clear, specific name (e.g., "MVP Development," "Security Audit Completion")
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of what you'll deliver
   - **Due Date**: When you expect to complete this phase
   - **Progress**: The current completion percentage (usually starts at 0%)

### Structure Your Milestones

- Create 3-12 milestones depending on your project's complexity
- Each milestone should represent a significant achievement
- Space them logically throughout your development timeline
- Ensure each has concrete, verifiable deliverables

### Strong Milestone Examples

For a blockchain project, milestones might include:
1. "Technical Specification and Architecture Documents"
2. "Testnet Implementation with Basic Functionality"
3. "Security Audit and Vulnerability Fixes"
4. "Public Beta Launch with Documentation"
5. "Mainnet Deployment and Feature Completion"

## Managing Your Active Project

Once your project is created, you have several tools to manage it effectively:

### Project Dashboard

- Access all management features from a central location
- The "Edit Project" button lets you update details and media
- Use tabs to navigate between Milestones, Funding, Team, Voting, and Comments

### Milestone Tracking

- Keep descriptions current with any scope changes
- Mark percentage progress to show advancement
- Submit evidence of completion when milestones are finished

### Supporter Engagement

- Respond to comments and questions promptly
- Post regular updates even between milestones
- Be transparent about challenges and how you're addressing them

## Best Practices for Success

Creators who succeed on Boundless typically follow these guidelines:

- **Be transparent**: Share both successes and challenges openly
- **Communicate regularly**: Post updates at least weekly
- **Set realistic milestones**: Under-promise and over-deliver
- **Respond to feedback**: Show that you value community input
- **Provide clear evidence**: Document milestone completions thoroughly
- **Maintain a professional presence**: Build credibility through consistency

The more trust you build with the community, the more likely your project is to receive full funding and support through each development phase.
